          Naofumi Iwatani, an otaku, becomes cursed with the fate of being the
          "Shield Hero." Armed with only a measly shield, Naofumi is belittled
          and ridiculed by his fellow heroes and the kingdom's people due to his
          weak offensive capabilities and lackluster personality. When the
          heroes are provided with resources and comrades to train with, Naofumi
          sets out with the only person willing to train alongside him, Malty
          Melromarc. He is soon betrayed by her, however, and becomes falsely
          accused of taking advantage of her.
